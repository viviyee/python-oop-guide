Methods:
Instance Methods: These methods are defined inside a class and are used to get or manipulate instance attributes.

Class Methods: These methods are decorated with @classmethod and are bound to the class rather than the instance. They can access and modify class-level variables.

Static Methods: These methods are decorated with @staticmethod and are not bound to the instance or the class. They are just like regular functions but are defined inside a class for organization purposes.
